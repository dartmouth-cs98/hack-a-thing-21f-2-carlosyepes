# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

So i tried to start off a game using GameMaker Studio 2, nothing too special just followed a really cool tutorial

## Who Did What?

TODO: who worked on what part?

## What you learned

So definitely had some trouble since the tutorial was 6 years old, and also GameMaker Studio 1, as opposed to the one I used. This led to lots of trouble either trying to locate features that were used in the tutorial and either weren't in the same spot, or just didnt exist in my free version :(.
